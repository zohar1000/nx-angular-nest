The project contains a sample app.

Angular version 10.0.11 and nest version 7.4.2.

<br/>

#### Angular optimization:
running without zone.js cannot be done because the themes needs it (material, bootstrap, etc).
using ngZoneEventCoalescing to reduce change detection cycles
OnPush strategy is used except in components having <router-outlet>, from some reason the navigation does not happen with OnPush.

configuration is made by using json5 file which enables comments

#### Serving
serve the server: nx serve api<br/>
serve the app: nx serve sample-app (or just: nx serve)

#### Building
